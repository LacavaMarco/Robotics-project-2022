# Robotics Project - a.y. 2021-2022
_Robotics 2022 project at Politecnico di Milano._

## Description
The project is divided in two parts, each part detailed specifications are described in the provided presentations. The project has been implemented in the C++ language and developed using ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04.

The instructions to run the project are provided in the 'instructions.txt' files present in the 'project' folders.

## The robot
### Omnidirectional robot

- **Mecanum wheels**
  - 4 wheels with rollers at 45¬∞
- **Encoders on each wheel**
  - RPM (very noisy)
  - Ticks (more accurate)
- **Geometric parameters:**
  - Wheel radius (ùëü)
  - Wheel position along x (¬±ùëô)
  - Wheel position along y (¬±ùë§)

## Project 1
#### I. Compute odometry using appropriate kinematics
- Compute robot linear and angular velocities v, ‚çµ from wheel encoders
- Compute odometry using both Euler and Runge-Kutta integration
  - ROS parameter for initial pose
- Calibrate (fine-tune) robot parameters to match ground truth
#### II. Compute wheel control speeds from v, ‚çµ
#### III. Add a service to reset the odometry to a specified pose (x,y,Œ∏)
#### IV. Use dynamic reconfigure to select between integration method

## Project 2
#### I. Write launch files to create the map
#### II. Write launch file to perform amcl based localization
#### III. Write service to save an image with the map and the trajectory of the robot
